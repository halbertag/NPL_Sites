EPA Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) Sites
=============

## Introduction
This is an interactive map of the NPL sites across the EPA Regions. There are 10 official EPA regions across the United States, including US territories. This map can be used to determine density of superfund sites and their spatial distribution.

## Major Functions
Each point is represented by a biohazard symbol, and is color coded according to the type of site. The markers are clickable, and give the type of site. There is a link in the legend for more information about what superfund sites are and the history behind them.

## Libraries and Data Sources
This web map uses data from the EPA’s “Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) Where You Live Map” for the point data. The biohazard symbolization is from the website font awesome. The color scheme is from color brewer, and the region polygons are from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) website.
